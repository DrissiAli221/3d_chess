# 3D Chess ♟️

A fancy 3D landing page for a chess set that doesn't exist. Built this to learn Three.js and have some fun with 3D on the web.

## What's This About?

I like chess. I wanted to learn 3D web stuff. So I made a premium-looking commercial page for an imaginary luxury chess set. The pieces float, spin, and react to scrolling.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** + **React 19**
- **Three.js** + **React Three Fiber**
- **GSAP** - smooth animations and scroll effects
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Lenis** - smooth scrolling

## Running It

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

_Built as a learning project. My focus has shifted to cloud engineering, but this was a fun detour into the 3D web world._
